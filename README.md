# veeam_tasks

So i did the task that was given in python, but i will also put the code in C because i did one years ago and was the code that i took inspiration.

# To test Python file:
python veeam_task_folders.py source_folder_path backup_folder_path 30(time in second to do refresh) log_file_path
